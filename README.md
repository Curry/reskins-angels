**A work-in-progress complete visual overhaul of Arch666Angel's suite of mods**  
This mod reskins the items, structures, equipment, and technologies added to Factorio by Angel's Mods, adding tier coloring and labels. As part of this, structures have been re-rendered in high resolution with Angel's permission (which will eventually be ported into the base Angel's mods).

This is a very early WIP release, and as such this mod is designed to work alongside ShinyAngelGFX. Currently Angel's Smelting's structures are fully supported.

**Updates**  
This mod is constantly being worked on, but I am a graduate student and school has resumed. Regular content updates will be released monthly, and critical bugfixes will be released on an as-needed basis.

It is also suggested if using this mod with [ShinyAngelGFX](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ShinyAngelGFX) to also use the mod [ShinyAngelGFX: Casting Machine Patch](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ShinyAngelGFX-casting-machine-patch) to allow casting machines to output fluids (such as coolant), which is currently bugged due to ShinyAngelGFX.

**Localization**  
You are welcome to help with localization, please use [this Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/factorio-mods-localization). You can find more details [here](https://github.com/dima74/factorio-mods-localization#how-to-translate-using-crowdin). Locale updates will be released on the weekend they are received from Crowdin.
